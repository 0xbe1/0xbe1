# ðŸ‘‹ I'm 0xbe1, a web3 buidler

I am building:
- Aptos DeFi at [ThalaLabs](https://twitter.com/ThalaLabs/) 
- [subgraphs](https://github.com/messari/subgraphs/tree/master/subgraphs) on [graphprotocol](https://github.com/graphprotocol)
- Tools. [miniscan](https://miniscan.xyz/) may be the simplest contract explorer on EVM, and [okgraph](https://okgraph.xyz/) the simplest subgraph explorer

Before my web3 journey, I built distributed systems at Twitter, Google and several startups
