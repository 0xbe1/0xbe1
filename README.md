# ðŸ‘‹ I'm @0xbe1

Just an ex- @twitter @google @amazon backend dev who recently jump into the web3 ocean

I am building:
- [multiple subgraphs](https://github.com/messari/subgraphs/tree/master/subgraphs/compound-forks) at Messari.
- [miniscan](https://miniscan.xyz) - a small site to help you find the key info of a smart contract.
- [name3](https://name3.org) - a small site to help you pick your untaken name in web3.
