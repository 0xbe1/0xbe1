# 👋 I'm @0xbe1

Just an ex- @twitter @google @amazon backend dev who recently jump into the web3 ocean

I am building:
- [startblock](https://startblock.vercel.app) - a small site to help you find the start block of a smart contract, on many networks.
- [name3](https://name3.org) - a small site to help you pick your untaken name in web3.
