# ðŸ‘‹ I'm @0xbe1

Just an ex- @twitter @google @amazon backend dev who recently jump into the web3 ocean

I am building:
- [name3](https://name3.org) - a small site to help you pick your untaken name in web3.
- [bayc-subgraph](https://github.com/0xbe1/bayc-subgraph) - Bored Ape Yacht Club data indexed in TheGraph.

<!---
0xbe1/0xbe1 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
