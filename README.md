# ðŸ‘‹ I'm 0xbe1

I'm leading the dev team at [Thala Labs](https://twitter.com/ThalaLabs) ($80M peak TVL, #1 on Aptos). Prior to this, I worked at Messari, Twitter, Google, and several startups.

## Work

- [Thala](https://app.thala.fi): Aptos DeFi HyperApp including stablecoin, AMM, LSD, launchpad, and more.
- [Messari Subgraphs](https://github.com/messari/subgraphs/commits?author=0xbe1): Index and standardize protocol data with The Graph.

## OSS

- [aptos-labs/aptos-core](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/commits?author=0xbe1): Small improvements on Aptos framework.
- [aptos-labs/explorer](https://github.com/aptos-labs/explorer/commits?author=0xbe1): Added read/write contract features to Aptos explorer.
- [thala.run](https://run.thala.dev/): Aptos contract explorer that works.
- [miniscan](https://miniscan.xyz/): Think Etherscan, but 10x simpler and supports 10+ chains.
- [okgraph](https://okgraph.xyz/): A subgraph status monitor.
